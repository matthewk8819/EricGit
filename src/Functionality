Blob: 
- create blob from file
- create object folder 
- puts blob into objects folder with zipped contents

Index: 
- initialize index file
- add a filename (does the sha1 conversion with naming) (also creates blob + creates objects folder)
- remove removes from index and removes blob 

Tree: 
- Writes to file with sha1 name of contents to objects with the array of strings
- assumes objects folder already exists 

Commit: 
- Creates a commit with first line = String inputed in the constructor (make this sha1 of tree eventually)
- Works with the child and parent assigning
- date = line with date and time 
- referencing parent/child - refers to the objects/sha1 of that object
